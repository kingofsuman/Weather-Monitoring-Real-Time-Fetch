# Weather-Monitoring-Real-Time-Fetch Using Weather API 
Project Outline: Real-Time Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
1. HTML Structure
Dashboard Elements: Sections for current weather, hourly rollups, and daily aggregates.
Data Cards: Display cards to show real-time weather metrics (temperature, humidity, etc.) and rolling averages.
Settings: Allow users to select units (Celsius/Fahrenheit), city, and update interval.

2. CSS for Styling
Use CSS to create a clean, responsive dashboard with card-like sections for weather data.

3. JavaScript for Real-Time Data Fetching and Aggregation
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data and process it in real-time. Aggregate weather data and update the dashboard at regular intervals.
